                                Each member of the group brings something uniquely suited to the ultimate goal of this project. Obviously, this is associated with enormous amount of responsibility, not only to our customer, partners but also among ourselves. Good and consistent communication is the key. Therefore,  meetings will be face to face and done every week to discuss strategies on how to address or prevent issues, progress of each department so far, finance  and new ideas. Daily communication is critical therefore an instant messaging group chat is created as well as email. Emailing is a good formal way of communicating and everyone is expected to answer their emails. Records of these formal communications are stored and discussed in meetings should one not be as compliant on replying back to others. For every other day of the week that we cannot meet physically, skyping is used so itâ€™s easier to discuss ideas and to have productive conversations.
